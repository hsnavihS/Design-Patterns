### Definition
The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

### Reasons to not use this pattern
- Global state is considered harmful.
- Difficult to unit test.
- Violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by controlling its own creation and lifecycle.
