### Definition
The factory pattern is a creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Usecase
When a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.
When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
