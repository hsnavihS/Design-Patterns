### Definition
The abstract factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

### Usecase
Extremely similar to factory method pattern, the abstract factory pattern is useful when we want a particular
factory to create more than one object type. This is useful when we want to create a family of related objects.
